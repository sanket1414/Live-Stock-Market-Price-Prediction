# Stock Predictions Live

Here I have tried to create the live stock price predictor considering only last value as the
feature, and used SVM to predict the output price.

![Output Sample](Output/output.png)

## How to run ?
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `python app.py`
3. Open up browser and type **localhost:8050**
4. Select company from option and you will see its stock prices

Obviously, this code needs hell lot of improvements considering many features affect the
stock value especially news and other players playing. So if you are interested to take
this code further, you can definitely send me pull request and improve the code :)
